Topic 1: How to Internet Works

1. Brief History: Web 1.0 -> Web 3.0

Web 1.0 (1990s – early 2000s) – The "Read-Only" Wed
 Websites were static with no interactivity* Built using HTML and CSS (no JavaScript)*
 Users could only read content; there was no user engagement*
 No social media or real-time interactions* Example: Early Yahoo! pages, simple blogs.

 Web 2.0 (2004 – Present) – The "Read-Write" Wed
 Enabled dynamic and interactive experiences*
 Technologies like AJAX and JavaScript allowed live updates without page
reloads*
 Social media, e-commerce, and cloud applications emerged*
 Users could generate content (comments, reviews, blog posts, real-time chats)*
 Example: Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Amazon.

 Web 3.0 (Emerging) – The "Decentralized" Wed
 Uses blockchain technology to ensure decentralization*
 AI-driven and privacy-focused to give users more control over data*
 Example: Cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, decentralized apps (Ethereum,
Filecoin)

SA Basics of Computer Communication & Data Transmission


Data Transmission & PacketL
 The internet sends data in packets, which are small chunks of informationb
 Each packet has4
 Header (destination and sender information)b
 Payload (actual data being transferred)b
 Uses TCP/IP protocols to ensure data reaches the right destination.

 Two Types of CommunicatioN
 Wired (Ethernet, Fiber Optics) – More stable and faster; used in officesb
 Wireless (Wi-Fi, 5G) – Provides flexibility but can be slower.

vQ Domain Names, IP Addresses, MAC Addresses, and Routing


IP Address (Internet Protocol AddressC
 A unique number assigned to every internet-connected devicec
 IPv4 (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx) has 4.3 billion addressesc
 IPv6 provides a larger address space for the future.


 MAC Address (Media Access ControlC
 A unique identifier assigned to a device’s network adapterc
 Example: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5Ec
 Used within local networks but not on the broader internet.

 Domain Names (Example: www.google.comC
 Human-friendly names mapped to IP addresses via DNS (Domain Name
System)c
 DNS servers resolve domain names into IP addresses.

 Routinr
 Routers and gateways direct traffic efficientlyc
 Packets take different routes to reach the destination efficiently.

jc Overview of ISP & DNS Functionality

 Internet Service Providers (ISP<
b Companies like Jio, Airtel, BSNL provide internet access_
b They act as intermediaries between users and the global internet.

 How DNS WorkF
b A user types www.google.com in a browser_
b The browser contacts a DNS server to get the IP address_
b The DNS translates the domain into an IP (e.g., 142.250.183.206)_
b The browser connects to the website’s server using the IP.

Topic 2: Client-Server Architecture
C. Introduction to the Client-Server Model

 What is a ClientR
/ A user’s device (computer, phone, tablet) that requests data from a server
/ Examples: Web browsers, mobile apps.

 What is a ServerR
/ A powerful computer that stores and delivers content or servicesK
/ Examples: Web servers, API servers, database servers.

 Example:
A client is like a customer at a restaurant, and the server is like a waiter bringing food
from the kitchen.

Topic 2: Client-Server Architecture
:. Differences Between Client and Server
  Feature          Client       Server
  Who Uses it?     End User     Handles Request
  Example          Web Browser  Website backend
  Processes        Display Ui   Manages Logic, Databases

Example
/ You visit YouTube → The client sends a request
/ The YouTube server processes it and responds with videos.


Topic 2: Client-Server Architecture
Y= HTTP Request/Response Cycle


How It WorkS
> Client sends a request (e.g., GET /index.html)3
> Server processes the request3
> Server responds with data3
> Client displays the content.


 HTTP MethodS
> GET → Retrieve data3
> POST → Send data (forms, logins)3
> PUT → Update data3
> DELETE → Remove data.


 Example:
A restaurant order – You (client) order pizza (GET), the kitchen (server) prepares it,
and you receive it.

Topic 2: Client-Server Architecture
Q= Frontend vs Backend, Static vs Dynamic Websites


 Frontend (Client-Side9
> Code that runs in the browser+
> Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.


 Backend (Server-Side9
> Code that runs on the server+
> Technologies: Node.js, Python, PHP.


 Static vs Dynamic Websites

 R Basics of Web Hostin<
 Web hosting stores websites for online access-
 Examples: Shared Hosting, VPS, Cloud Hosting-
 Popular Providers: GoDaddy, Hostinger, AWS, Netlify.


 Analogy:
Hosting is like renting an apartment for your website
