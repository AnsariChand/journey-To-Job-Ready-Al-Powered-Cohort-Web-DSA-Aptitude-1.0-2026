📘 Day 3 – Understanding Simple Interest (SI) Concepts & Easy Tricks
🎯 Batch: Job Ready AI Powered Cohort Web + DSA + Aptitude 1.0
🔹 1. What is Simple Interest?

Simple Interest (SI) is the extra money paid on a Principal amount (P) for a certain Time (T) at a given Rate (R%).

👉 It is calculated only on the original principal, not on interest.

🔹 2. Simple Interest Formula
SI

=

(P

×

R

×

T)

/

100
SI = (P × R × T) / 100

Where:

P = Principal (original money)

R = Rate of interest (per year)

T = Time (in years)

🔹 3. Basic Example

Example 1:
Principal = ₹1000
Rate = 10% per year
Time = 2 years

𝑆
𝐼
=
(
1000
×
10
×
2
)
/
100
SI=(1000×10×2)/100
𝑆
𝐼
=
200
SI=200

✅ Interest = ₹200

✅ Total Amount = 1000 + 200 = ₹1200


🔥 Easy Tricks (Very Important for Exams)
✅ Trick 1: Interest for 1 Year

If rate is 10%, then:

👉 10% of 1000 = 100

So 1 year interest = 100
For 2 years → 100 × 2 = 200

No need of full formula 😎

✅ Trick 2: When Time is in Months

Formula becomes:

𝑆
𝐼
=
(
𝑃
×
𝑅
×
𝑇
)
/
(
100
×
12
)
SI=(P×R×T)/(100×12)

OR

👉 Convert months into years first.

Example:
P = 2400
R = 5%
T = 6 months

6 months = 6/12 = 1/2 year

𝑆
𝐼
=
(
2400
×
5
×
1
/
2
)
/
100
SI=(2400×5×1/2)/100
𝑆
𝐼
=
60
SI=60
✅ Trick 3: Quick Percentage Method

If rate is 5% per year
For 3 years → 5 × 3 = 15%

So directly calculate 15% of Principal

Much faster in exams 🔥

🔹 4. Important Types of Questions
🟢 Type 1: Find Interest

Q1: Find SI on ₹5000 at 8% for 2 years.

𝑆
𝐼
=
(
5000
×
8
×
2
)
/
100
SI=(5000×8×2)/100
𝑆
𝐼
=
800
SI=800
🟢 Type 2: Find Principal

Q2: SI = ₹600, Rate = 10%, Time = 3 years. Find P.

Formula:

𝑃
=
(
𝑆
𝐼
×
100
)
/
(
𝑅
×
𝑇
)
P=(SI×100)/(R×T)
𝑃
=
(
600
×
100
)
/
(
10
×
3
)
P=(600×100)/(10×3)
𝑃
=
2000
P=2000
🟢 Type 3: Find Rate
𝑅
=
(
𝑆
𝐼
×
100
)
/
(
𝑃
×
𝑇
)
R=(SI×100)/(P×T)
🟢 Type 4: Find Time
𝑇
=
(
𝑆
𝐼
×
100
)
/
(
𝑃
×
𝑅
)
T=(SI×100)/(P×R)
